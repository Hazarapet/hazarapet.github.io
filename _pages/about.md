I am a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at <strong><a href="https://www.picsart.com" target="_blank">Picsart</a></strong>, 
working on generative tasks such as text-to-image synthisis and its customizations. 
Also, I worked on other computer vision tasks which included semantic and instance segmentation, object detection, and object tracking.

My research interests align with Deep Generative Methods, Conditional and Unconditional Diffusion, Multi-Modal Large Language Models, and Iterative Optimization Problems.

I hold M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in Informatics and Applied Mathematics
from <strong><a href="http://www.ysu.am/ysu/en" target="_blank">Yerevan State University (YSU)</a></strong> 
and have more than 5 years of experience in software engineering.
